# BE-205-Assn1
Assignment 1: Cell Classification

To test the model with external data, use the final 2 cells in assn1.ipynb and change the filepath of the input data. The first cell is using the model trained with only selected cell types (excluding Unknown and FAILED_HARMONIZATION), while the second cell is using the model trained on all cell types. The cells call the functions test_model_external_selected and test_model_external_all, respectively. 

Note: it should take ~5 min to execute (due to pre-processing time)
